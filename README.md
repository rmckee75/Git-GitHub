In this assignment, I learned how to link a repo to GitHub by using "git remote" and "git push origin (on GitHub) master (local repo)"

### Lessons & Methods
In this assignment I created a personal copy of the ClassAccounts page on GitHub (fork), then made a local copy of that repo (clone).  To get your newly added info onto the main ClassAccounts page, you need to wait for the owner (Dr. Shields) to accept your pull request.
